The code included in this directory will show how to do several different things needed to get a rover into
working order for the CSGC cyearly challenge.

Examples:
    1: Basic Navigation (C++, Arduino.ino, microPython)
    2: Basic Movement (C++, Arduino, microPython)
    3: Basic Timer and Uses (C++, Arduino.ino, microPython)

If other examples are needed make a request with an issue.
