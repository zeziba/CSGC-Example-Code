The movement code includes will utilize a basic servo motor as the use case. The use case is as follows,
a continuous rotation servo with a motor shield.

There are more use cases such as stepper motors or dc brush or brush-less motors to consider.
NOTE: DC motors are simply continuous rotation motors with the direction and speed dependant on the input voltage/amps
along with the polarity. These motors need

There are several types of servo motors and the one used in this example is a continuous rotation type which
will only go in one direction at a time with the speed dependant on the input square wave.

These products are not required for the examples to work. Comparable products will work and some might need
minor changes.

NOTE: Always design your code based on the specification's of the devices used, this information is generally
obtained from the spec sheet/datasheet.
