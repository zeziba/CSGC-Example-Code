The code include assumes you have pulled the arduino servo library and have installed it correctly.

The library can be found here
https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo

This code does not create its own library for use but relies on the Arduino Servo library.

In the included example the code displays how to import and attach a servo for control and use.

The ide used was atom. Atom allows cpp code to be used instead of the default arduino .ino files.
